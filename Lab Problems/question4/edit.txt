Dowry system evil in society. 
It has reduced sacred affair of marriage 
to a business deal. Brides are treated as a marketable 
commodity. parents of brides are often put under 
inhuman pressure for a handsome dowry. Sometimes they 
become paupers to get their daughters married. In many cases, young brides are ruthlessly tortured or pushed to suicide. 
 
To eradicate this social evil, a total change in outlook of society a must. woman has to be considered as an equal partner to man. Widespread education and employment and their rights to property can bring about right remedy. Legal prohibition of dowry not enough. Strong social disapproval of dowry only guarantee against this evil. Our youth should come forward to generate public awareness against this shameful custom.
