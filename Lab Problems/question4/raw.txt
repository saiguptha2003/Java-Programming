The Dowry system is evil in society.
It has reduced the sacred affair of marriage
to a business deal. Brides are treated as a marketable 
commodity. The parents of the brides are often put under 
inhuman pressure for a handsome dowry. Sometimes they 
become paupers to get their daughters married. In many cases, young brides are ruthlessly tortured or pushed to suicide.

To eradicate this social evil, a total change in the outlook of society is a must. The woman has to be considered as an equal partner to the man. Widespread education and employment and their rights to property can bring about the right remedy. Legal prohibition of dowry is not enough. Strong social disapproval of dowry is the only guarantee against this evil. Our youth should come forward to generate public awareness against this shameful custom.
